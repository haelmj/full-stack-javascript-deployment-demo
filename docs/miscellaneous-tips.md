# Tips

## Repository Management

### Why It Matters

Effectively managing your repository ensures that the project is accessible, maintainable, and comprehensible for both current developers and any potential collaborators in the future.

### Best Practices

- **Branch Management**: Create separate branches for features, bug fixes, or experiments. This keeps the main branch stable and clean.

- **Merge Requests/Pull Requests**: Before merging changes, review the code changes with peers. This ensures quality and shared understanding.

- **Issue Tracking**: Use the issue tracker provided by platforms like GitHub or GitLab. It's a great way to keep tabs on bugs, features, and discussions.

- **Use .gitignore**: Ensure you're not committing sensitive information or unnecessary files to the repository.

## State Management in Web Applications

In modern web applications, managing state effectively can pose challenges, particularly as the application grows in complexity. State management tools and libraries offer methods to handle application-wide state data adeptly, ensuring components remain synchronised and state is predictable. While discussions on state management often focus on frontend frameworks and libraries, backend applications also manage state â€” typically through databases, caching mechanisms, and session management.

### Why State Management Matters

As applications grow and user interactions become more complex, tracking changes and ensuring that different parts of the app are in sync can be a daunting task. Here, state management tools come to the rescue:

- **Predictability**: Ensure consistent behavior in your app by having a predictable state change.

- **Debugging**: Some state management tools offer excellent debugging capabilities, making it easier to trace and fix issues.

- **Code Organisation**: They encourage structured and modular code, which is easier to maintain.

### Options for State Management

#### Frontend State Management

1. **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps. [Documentation](https://redux.js.org/)

1. **MobX**: Makes state management simple and scalable using TFRP (transparently applying functional reactive programming). [Documentation](https://mobx.js.org/README.html)

1. **Context API & useState**: Reactâ€™s built-in way. [Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

1. **Apollo Client**: For GraphQL. [Documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)

#### Backend State Management

1. **Databases**: The primary mechanism for maintaining persistent state.

   - [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/): An advanced, enterprise-class, and open-source relational database system.
   - [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/): A popular NoSQL database.
   - [**Neo4j**](https://neo4j.com/): A leading graph database platform.

1. **Caching Mechanisms**: Tools like [Redis](https://redis.io/) allow you to store and manage temporary state, speeding up repeated queries and reducing database load.

1. **Session Management**: For web apps, session libraries like [`express-session`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) for Express.js let you manage user session state.

1. **Message Queues**: Tools like [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) or [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) can maintain state in the form of messages, especially in distributed systems.

## Libraries to Consider

Whether you're crafting the front-end or the back-end of an app, libraries can provide vital tools to streamline the process and enhance functionality. Here are some libraries that can help you with you app.

### Backend

- **jsonwebtoken**: Perfect for authentication. This library lets you decode, verify and generate JWT. [Documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)

### Frontend

- **React-Router**: Declarative routing for React. Helps in navigating between different components, changing the browser URL, modifying the browser history, or keeping the UI state in sync. [Documentation](https://reactrouter.com/)

- **Axios**: An excellent tool for making HTTP requests. It's more intuitive and can be used in both the browser and Node.js. [Documentation](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)

- **styled-components**: Level up your styling game! This library lets you write actual CSS in your JavaScript, encapsulating styles at a component level. [Documentation](https://styled-components.com/docs)
