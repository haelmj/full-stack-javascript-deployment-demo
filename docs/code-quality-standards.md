# Code Quality and Structure

**Purpose:** Creating a functional app is great, but writing high-quality, structured code ensures that your application is scalable, maintainable, and less prone to bugs. As you embark on this journey, remember: quality over quantity!

## Best Practices

- **Naming Conventions:** Consistency is key. Whether it's variables, functions, or classes, always follow a clear naming convention. For instance, in JavaScript, using camelCase for variables and functions and PascalCase for classes is common.

**Example:** `getUserData()` (for a function) and `UserProfile` (for a class).

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid duplicating code. Instead, identify patterns and create reusable functions or components.

**Example:** Instead of writing the same data validation logic in multiple places, create a utility function.

- **Comments and Documentation:** Write meaningful comments, especially for complex logic. However, refrain from over-commenting; your code should be self-explanatory whenever possible. There's also a special commenting format called [JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc) annotations that allows developers to create documentation for their APIs, which is also used by most popular IDEs like VS Code to provide Intellisense functionality.

**Example:** For a tricky algorithm, a brief overview can be very helpful, but avoid comments like `// increments i by 1` for basic operations.

- **Code Formatting:** Use tools like [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) or [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to automatically format and lint your code, ensuring it adheres to certain standards and is readable.

For a more comprehensive understanding on Naming Conventions, Comments and Documentation you can refer to [our book on documentation](https://tanyapowell.gitbook.io/documentation-the-art-of-effective-communication/) (don't worry, it's free)

## Design Patterns

- **MVC (Model-View-Controller):** A widely used pattern, especially in web applications, that divides your application into three interconnected components.

  - **Model:** Manages the data and business logic.

  - **View:** Handles the UI and presentation.

  - **Controller:** Intermediary that takes user input from the View, processes it (with potential updates to the Model), and returns the display output.

**Example:** In a user registration system, the "Model" checks the validity of user data, the "View" displays the registration form, and the "Controller" manages the user input and response display.

- **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access. This is useful for services like database connections.

**Example:** A database connection class where you want to ensure that only one connection is active throughout the application's lifecycle.

- **Observer Pattern:** Allows an object (known as the subject) to publish changes to its state, so that other objects (observers) can react in response.

**Example:** In a chat application, when a user sends a message (change in state), all other users in the chatroom (observers) are notified.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Readable Code:** Understand the importance of writing code that not only machines can understand but also your fellow developers. This is essential for team projects and future maintenance.

- **Scalability and Maintainability:** Recognise how applying best practices and design patterns can lead to a more scalable and maintainable application structure.

- **Pattern Implementation:** Be able to identify scenarios in your application where certain design patterns would be beneficial and implement them effectively.

- **Efficient Problem Solving:** By following best practices and using design patterns, you'll foster an analytical mindset, helping you tackle complex problems more efficiently.

Coding is an art as much as it's a science. Remember to take a step back, review, refactor, and keep pushing for that clean, structured code. Happy coding! ðŸš€ðŸ’¡
