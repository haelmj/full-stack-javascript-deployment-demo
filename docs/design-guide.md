# Design

**Purpose:** A clear, intuitive design is crucial for any application. This not only enhances the user experience but also determines how successfully users will be able to interact with your platform. Here's a breakdown of your tasks:

## User Flow

1. **Research:** Start by understanding the needs and pain points of your target audience. This can be done through surveys, studying analytics, or even interviewing potential users

1. **Mapping:** Create a flowchart or a series of sketches that illustrate every step a user might take in your application, from landing on the home page to completing a primary action

1. **Iterations:** As you proceed with development, continually revisit and refine your user flow. This ensures your design evolves with the practical needs and challenges of the application

### Tools & Resources

**Flowchart makers:** Tools like [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/) or [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) can help map out your application flow.

## UI/UX

- **Inspiration:** Browse websites like [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) or [Behance](https://www.behance.net/) to gather inspiration. This will help you understand modern design trends and what's feasible.

- **Wireframing:** Before jumping into detailed designs, create wireframes. These are simple, schematic representations of your layouts, helping you plot elements on the page. They're meant to be rough and quick.

- **Prototyping:** Using tools like Figma or Adobe XD, transform your wireframes into clickable prototypes. This will give you a pseudo-live experience of your application's flow and design.

- **Feedback:** Share your designs with peers, mentors, or potential users to gather feedback. Adjust your designs based on this feedback.

- **Performance & Accessibility:** As you polish your design, it's important to keep these two factors in mind. Use Google Lighthouse to analyse and get insights on how well your application fares in terms of performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practices.

## Learning Outcomes

- **User-Centric Approach:** Understand how placing the user at the centre of your design process results in more effective and successful applications.

- **Iterative Design:** Appreciate the importance of continuous feedback and refinement in the design process, ensuring the final product is both functional and appealing.

- **Tool Mastery:** Familiarise yourself with industry-standard tools for design, wireframing, and prototyping, making you better equipped for real-world projects.

- **Performance & Accessibility:** Recognise the importance of creating designs that are not only visually appealing but also performant and accessible to all users.

Remember, design isn't just about making things look good. It's about making sure the user has an intuitive, enjoyable experience. So, dive deep into these guidelines and let your creativity shine! ðŸŒŸðŸŽ¨
